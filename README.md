This is currently a **work in progress**. I'm expecting to rebase those commit
(and maybe even restard from scratch) once I have a clearer view of what I want
to make, and how to do it.

# Goal

The goal is to be able to see all relation between functions, including when
traits or function pointers are used.

An example of rust project have been added in `test/test1/`. The goal is to be
able to generate a file similar to `test/test1/test1.dot`, and then use tool
like `graphviz` to generate the file `test/test1/test1.svg`. Oh, and that file
has hyperlink to the documentation generated by `cargo doc
--document-private-items`!
